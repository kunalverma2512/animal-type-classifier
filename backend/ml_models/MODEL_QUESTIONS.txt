IMPORTANT: Questions for Your Team Member About cattle_model.pth

The cattle_model.pth file contains raw model weights (state_dict) but we need:

1. **Model Architecture**: What is the exact model architecture?
   - Is it YOLO11m? YOLO11n? YOLOv8? Custom model?
   - What's the class count (number of views)?
   
2. **Training Details**:
   - Was it trained with ultralytics? Or custom PyTorch code?
   - What framework was used for training?
   
3. **Class Names**: What are the class names/view names?
   - Example: {0: 'front', 1: 'rear', 2: 'side', 3: 'top', 4: 'bottom'}
   - We need the EXACT mapping from class index to view name
   
4. **Input Size**: What image size does the model expect?
   - 640x640? 224x224? Other?

SOLUTIONS:

Option A: If trained with Ultralytics YOLO
-----------------------------------------
They should provide the .pt file from the runs/classify/train/weights/best.pt
That file will work directly with our code.

Option B: If it's a custom model
---------------------------------
We need the model architecture code to load the weights properly.

Option C: Quick Test (Try this first!)
---------------------------------------
If they used YOLO11m-cls, try this:

from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load pretrained YOLO11m classifier
model = YOLO('yolo11m-cls.pt')  # Downloads if not exists

# Load your custom weights
model.model.load_state_dict(torch.load('cattle_model.pth'))

# Save as proper .pt file
model.save('cattle_model_converted.pt')

But we need to know:
- Exact YOLO version (yolo11m-cls, yolo11n-cls, yolov8m-cls, etc.)
- Number of classes in their model

Please ask your team member for these details!
